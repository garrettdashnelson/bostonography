Uses Boston as a case study for integrating computational methods with the social sciences and humanities to provide new insights into major cultural, historical, and societal questions as they relate to and extend beyond the city of Boston. Through lectures, discussions, and labs, the course examines a variety of data sets that measure geographic, historical, literary, political, civic, and institutional landscapes. Offers students an opportunity to combine analytical tools, such as geospatial mapping, data visualization, and network science, with readings, hands-on class activities, and museum or site visits, enabling a comprehensive view of complex cultural and social phenomena.

# About the class

Class Expectations: 

**Attendance**: Students should make every effort to be regularly engaged in the course week-to-week. Although much of the course is asynchronous, it will ordinarily not be possible to revert to past weeks to make up new ground. Exceptions will be made for students with accommodation letters from the Disability Resource Center and may be extended to students who are dealing with extraordinary circumstances. Students who find themselves facing extenuating circumstances should contact me as early as possible, as I may be less able to help if you disappear from class for an extended period. 

**Medical or Family Emergencies**: Students who face medical or family emergencies during the term should contact the Office of Student Affairs, who will then notify your professors ([About Us - Northeastern Student Life](https://studentlife.northeastern.edu/about/)). For your own privacy, please do not send me medical documentation.  
 
**Academic Integrity**: You are expected to do your own thinking, write your own words, and create your own arguments. If you use someone else’s words, ideas, or arguments, you must always make that clear in your paper using footnotes, citations, or references. Please ask if you have questions about citation. Cases of academic dishonesty will be reported to Northeastern. For more information see [Northeastern’s Academic Integrity Policy](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies-procedures/integrity-policy/#:~:text=Honor%20Code%20The%20following%20honor%20code%20was%20designed,are%20expected%20of%20me%20as%20a%20Northeastern%20student.).
 
**Checking Email**: You should get in the habit of checking your Northeastern email regularly. We send announcements, assignments, and other course materials via email. Students are responsible for knowing the contents of those emails. Please note that due to federal privacy laws and institutional policies, we cannot discuss grades over email. If you have questions about assignments, you should contact the faculty to arrange an appointment. We are also unable to discuss either course content, or an individual student’s progress with anyone but the student. 
 
**Canvas Course Site**: Please visit the course site regularly, check for announcements, and access readings. Students are responsible for knowing the content of course documents and announcements. 
 
**Late Assignment Policy**: Students are responsible for making sure they understand all expectations and keep track of deadlines. If you run into problems, please email the faculty to make other arrangements. Please note that I will be more flexible, given the pandemic, but may be less able to accept tardy work towards the end of the semester. It may also limit my ability to provide feedback. 

**Incompletes**: Incompletes are awarded only for extenuating circumstances that are beyond the student’s control and limited to students who are in good standing and who have completed most of their course work. Students who think they may need an incomplete should contact me to discuss the procedure. Students with significant absences and/or missing several major assignments may not be eligible. 

**Classroom Citizenship**: The classroom is a professional environment. Uncivil conduct towards other students or the professor is a violation of the student code of conduct and will not be tolerated. “Incivility” includes the use of racial, ethnic, trans/homophobic, or ableist slurs, derogatory comments about classmates, or other disrespectful conduct. Students are also responsible for adhering to Northeastern’s Student Code of Conduct: Code of Student Conduct | Office of Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution (northeastern.edu) 
 
**Technology**: All students should be mindful that technology is not infallible. It is wise to save a second copy of your paper somewhere you can access it if your computer fails. For federal and state law privacy reasons, you may not record class without obtaining permission of the instructor. Lecture content is the intellectual property of the instructor. Recording of lectures is only permitted as part of an approved accommodation, and recordings may not be distributed, shared, or edited/altered without the instructor’s permission, per Northeastern’s Student Code of Conduct. To preserve student privacy, discussions should not be recorded. Please limit your laptop, tablet, or phone usage to classroom activities, such as notetaking or accessing textbooks/library resources. Students whose technology usage becomes a distraction to their fellow students, or the instructor may be asked to put their devices away.  


**Grades**: Most assignments will be graded within two weeks. Grades are only changed in case of a mathematical error. When graded assignments are returned, please take the time to read your feedback before coming to me with questions or concerns about grades. If you still have concerns about your grade after reading your feedback, please write me a memo, which includes a paragraph-length response that directly addresses each of your concerns raised by your feedback, using the assignment guidelines, and explaining why it merits a re-grade. I will take your concerns seriously, but there are no guarantees that your grade will be changed, and all decisions are final. Please note I can only assign grades based on the quality of the final product, and cannot take effort, life circumstances or other factors into consideration. If you are unclear on the expectations for an assignment, it is your responsibility to ask for clarification in advance of the assignment’s deadline. You should bring any concerns about your grade to my attention within a week of receiving the graded paper back. Queries made thereafter will not be entertained. 


**Grading Policy**: 

Listed below are the criteria for the various letter grades used in this course: 

A:	This is a superior grade and is given to work that has far exceeded the specific requirements of the assignment. Additionally, a student receiving this grade must have shown both insight and initiative in completing the graded task. 

B:	This is a very good grade and is given to work that has carefully and thoroughly met the specific requirements of the assignment and shows evidence of extra effort. 

C:	This is an average grade and is given to work that has met the specific requirements of the assignment. 

D:	This is a below average grade and is indicative of work not completed. It is given when the specific requirements of an assignment are not met. 

F:	This is a failing grade and is given to work that is wholly inadequate as a representation of college-level work. 

0:	This is a grade given when an assignment is not turned in. Most work will be assigned some points. Try to avoid not doing your assignments. 

  

Final letter grades will be assigned on the following numerical basis:  A=100-94; A-=93-90; B+=89-87; B=86-84; B-=83-80; C+=79-77; C=76-74; C-= 73-70; D+=69-67; D=66-64; D-= 63-60; F=59-below 


**Academic Integrity**: You are expected to do your own thinking, write your own words, and create your own arguments. If you use someone else’s words, ideas, or arguments, you must always make that clear in your paper using footnotes, citations, or references. Please ask if you have questions about citation. Cases of academic dishonesty will be reported to Northeastern University.  
 

**Accommodations for Disabilities**: 

Reasonable accommodations will be provided for students with documented physical, sensory, systemic, cognitive, learning, and psychiatric disabilities. If you have a disability or medical condition and anticipate that you will need reasonable accommodation in this class, you will need to work with the Disability Resource Center: 617-373-2675. The procedure for requesting accommodations, and other information, is available at the [Disability Resource Center](https://drc.sites.northeastern.edu/). All information and documentation are confidential.
